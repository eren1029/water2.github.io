    <i><h1 style="color: gray; text-align: center;">WATER AVAILABILITY</h1></i>
      <div class="note"><p>A broad topic, encompassing the biophysical supply of water, the demand for water, and access to water.
Water cycles through the earth system, precipitating from the atmosphere and becoming available as surface water and
groundwater. The papers in the initial sections define water fluxes and storage and describe methods for quantifying them.
Most analyses of water availability rely on hydrologic models, so included is a standalone section devoted to papers discussing
the ways in which models differ and what they are most useful for. Models are useful for quantification and prediction, but the
water cycle is variable. Drought describes periods when water availability is limited, and papers in this section define and
identify drought in a variety of ways. Unpredictability and changes in water availability will increase in an era of global change.
The effects of land-use change and of changing climate are explored both conceptually and through quantitative modeling.
The preceding sections address the presence of water, but presence does not guarantee availability. The following sections
address water availability. To state that water is available implies that it is available for ecosystems and human societies to
use. The section on water use addresses sources of water and demand for water in agriculture, in households and industry,
and for nature. The physical presence of water also does not ensure that it is available to those who need it. Water
accessibility is related to physical factors such as infrastructure and also to the political context of governance. When demand
for water is unmet, people experience water scarcity. Water scarcity can be quantified in a variety of ways, and potential
solutions to scarcity are often a function of how it is defined. Even though there are many elements to water availability, it is
clear that it cannot be understood without an integrated, interdisciplinary assessment of both biophysical and social factors.

            <ul>
                <li>Water is one of the most important resources on the planet. Without water, life cannot exist. But what makes water so important? Water has several unique characteristics that make it an extremely valuable resource. Some such properties of water are listed below:</li>
                <li>Water is a very good solvent – it has the ability to dissolve many substances.</li>
                <li>The boiling point and freezing point of water make it easily available in all three states (solid, liquid, and gaseous).</li>
                <li>The specific heat of water is quite high. This enables water to absorb and release heat slowly, thereby regulating the temperature of its environment.</li>
                <li>Owing to its transparency, water can allow light to reach the life forms that are submerged in it. This is crucial for the survival of plant life in the oceans, lakes, and rivers.</li>
                <li>Water is neither acidic nor basic in nature. It has a pH of 7, making it a neutral substance.</li>

<h3>Global Water Availability</h3>
<p>
<FONT COLOR=BLACK>People have a tremendous impact on water availability. Through direct management, including damming rivers and cultivating
the land surface, and indirectly, mostly pressingly by changing the earth’s climate, people have altered the amount of water
available to them. This new era, in which people affect the earth as much as or more than earth-system processes do, has
been called the Anthropocene. Meybeck 2003 introduces the idea of the Anthropocene specifically in the context of water.
Vorosmarty, et al. 2000 elaborates on the human factors that affect the water cycle, and Haddeland, et al. 2014 provides a
quantitative estimate of the magnitude of the direct and indirect pathways of influence. Not all regions of the world will be
affected in the same way by changes in land use and climate. Alcamo and Henrichs 2002 identifies the ~10 percent of global
land area that is likely to be heavily affected by water shortage due to global change, and Lehner, et al. 2006 evaluates the
likelihood of increased flooding at smaller scales. Milly, et al. 2008 argues that the central paradigm of water resources
management, which is based on the idea that knowledge of past water flow allows prediction of future water flow, is no longer
accurate in the Anthropocene and that this paradigm must change.
</p>

<h3>Groundwater</h3>
<p>
<FONT COLOR=BLACK>Groundwater is a key water source for both agricultural and household use because it can often be accessed though a well,
obviating the need for substantial infrastructure, and because aquifers serve as storage so water can be tapped “on demand”
when needed. Yet, because it is out of sight, quantifying available groundwater resources is difficult. Zektser and Everett 2004
provides an overview of groundwater availability and use globally and details the ways groundwater is measured and
characterized. Strassberg, et al. 2009 documents changes in groundwater by using the GRACE satellite. In addition to
explaining the technology, this article is particularly useful because it compares satellite measurements to ground-based
measurements. Zhou 2009 tackles the question of how much and how fast water ought to be withdrawn from an aquifer,
reviewing arguments about drawdown, recharge, and discharge. One reason evaluating safe or sustainable groundwater use
is difficult is that groundwater is not separate from surface water, though they are often evaluated and managed separately.
Döll, et al. 2012 focuses on interconnections between ground and surface water and evaluates how groundwater use for
irrigation, household use, and manufacturing can affect surface flows, and vice versa. Siebert, et al. 2010 focuses explicitly on
groundwater use for agriculture; in presenting their findings they provide a useful discussion of why it is difficult to track
groundwater use. Groundwater recharge occurs at different rates in different aquifers, and some groundwater is effectively
nonrenewable. Foster and Chilton 2003 explores how different types of groundwater might be used sustainably. Steward, et al.
2013 evaluates optimal ways to use groundwater when it is essentially a fixed resource.
</p>
<h3>Factors Affecting Water Availability</h3>
<p>
<FONT COLOR=BLACK>Several factors influence water availability, including climate, geography, population density, water management practices, and pollution levels. Areas with low rainfall, such as deserts, are naturally water-scarce, while regions with abundant rainfall and well-managed water resources tend to have better water availability.
</p>

<h3>Water Management</h3>
<p>
<FONT COLOR=BLACK>Effective water management is crucial for ensuring water availability. This includes the responsible use of water resources, efficient irrigation practices in agriculture, sustainable groundwater management, and measures to reduce water pollution.</p>




<h3>Sustainable Development Goal (SDG)</h3>
<p>
<FONT COLOR=BLACK> The United Nations has included clean water and sanitation as one of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to be achieved by 2030. The aim is to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all.
</p>


<h2>Sources of water</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<FONT COLOR=black>The following are the different water sources:
<ul>
  <li>
    <FONT COLOR=Black>Rainwater: The primary source of water is rain. It is considered to be the purest form of natural water available. The rains also carry the smoke and dust particles into the atmosphere. As a result, the initial rain shower has a lot of pollutants.</li>
  <li>
    Oceans and seas: Oceans contain over 97 percent of the water on the planet. However, this water is too salty to drink, cultivate, or irrigate.</li>
  <li>
    River and lakes: Rainwater that falls on the earth’s surface is transmitted down the slope of the ground into rivers and streams. Water from melting glaciers on the mountains often falls into some rivers.
  </li>
  <li>
    Groundwater: A portion of the rain seeps through a layer of the earth when it rains. This water eventually reaches solid rocks and collects as groundwater. Drilling wells or sinking tube wells can also attain the water table and acquire groundwater.
  </li>
  
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Water Use</h3>
<p>
<FONT COLOR=BLACK>To say that water is available implies that there is a demand for water. People use water in a variety of ways, extracting it from
rivers, lakes, and groundwater for uses such as irrigation, domestic needs, manufacturing, and thermoelectric power
production, and also using it in-stream for activities such as transportation, support of fisheries, and hydroelectric power
production. Gleick 2014 complies statistics about water use and includes essays on timely water management issues. Molden
and Sakthivadivel 1999 introduces a water balance approach for tracking water use and provides useful definitions. Water can
often be reused, so using a water resource does not necessarily mean it is no longer available. Perry, et al. 2009 clarifies the
distinction between water withdrawals (i.e., the amount of water removed from a resource) and water consumption (i.e., the
amount of that water that is transferred to the atmosphere and thus cannot be immediately used again). This is particularly
relevant in agriculture, which they focus on, because agriculture is the sector that consumes the most water. De Fraiture and
Wichelns 2010 also focuses on agriculture and efficiency, evaluating future irrigation demand and the way efficiency may or
may not help sate that demand. Water withdrawals and consumption for domestic and municipal use are much smaller than for
agriculture, but these uses are important for both human rights and economic reasons. Flörke, et al. 2013 quantifies the
volume of water consumed in households and by industry globally. Padowski and Jawitz 2012 focuses on cities, evaluating
both demand and identifying sources of supply that may reach beyond a local watershed due to water transfers. Srinivasan, et
al. 2010 evaluates water demand and supply from urban actors other than those directly connected to a municipal water
system.
</p>

<h3>
Water Consumption
</h3>
<p>
<font color=black>Water is required for the survival of all living species. On the other hand, humans rely on water more than plants and animals. We use water for a variety of uses in our daily activities, including:
</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
      Domestic uses: Water is required for drinking, cleaning, cooking, including washing, among other things. Each individual in the house uses an average of 260 litres of water each day for various activities.
      </li>
      <li>
      Industrial uses: Water is used extensively in our industries at many phases of production, from using water as a raw material to the generation of energy. The usage differs per industry.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Governance</h3>
<p>
<FONT COLOR=BLACK>The way that people acquire access to water varies across societies and time. Franks and Cleaver 2007 defines governance,
relying on theory and illustrating key concepts with a case study. Tropp 2007 provides a historical perspective on efforts to
improve access to water, transitioning from a focus almost solely on water infrastructure and technology to a focus on
governance. Schmidt and Peppard 2014 reviews how access to water has been conceptualized historically. Dellapenna and
Gupta 2008 focuses on water law, providing quite a bit of history. Mukherji and Shah 2005 focuses specifically on groundwater,
which tends to have quite different governance because it is distributed and not an integrated system. Ray 2007 evaluates
women’s access to water with a focus on how gender-neutral water-development policies have frequently had unintended
negative impacts on women. Crow and Sultana 2002 also focuses on women’s access to water and extends the discussion to
how women’s access varies according to their social class; an excellent case study from Bangladesh is provided.
</p>
<h4>
<font color=Black>Why does water availability matter?
</h4>
<p>
<font color=black>water is vital for agriculture, human consumption, industry, and energy generation. If local
surface water and groundwater are used up or contaminated beyond use, it becomes necessary to turn to alternative,
often more expensive water sources.
</p>
<h3>What is Water Scarcity??</h3>
<p>
<FONT COLOR=BLACK>Although the definition of water scarcity may at first appear obvious (i.e., the lack of sufficient water to meet demand) in
practice the concept is complex. Savenije 2000 lays out the issues clearly and thoroughly, highlighting in particular that water
demand by food production dominates the amount of water a person needs. Ohlsson and Turton 1999 describes the
interwoven social challenges of reduced water resources followed by adaptation to the new state. Srinivasan, et al. 2012
evaluates water scarcity as a combined function of water supply and demand, governance, and infrastructure. Garrick and Hall
2014 takes a risk-analysis perspective on water scarcity and focuses on built infrastructure. Postel 2000 provides many
examples of societies facing the challenges of water limitation. Linton 2004 analyzes the water scarcity literature itself,
deconstructing the evolution of the discourse on the global water crisis. Rijsberman 2006 subscribes to the idea that a water
crisis came about only after it could be quantified. He provides an excellent critique of water scarcity indicators. Brown and
Matlock 2011 provides a thorough overview of existing water scarcity indicators and the range of thresholds they use to
demarcate scarcity
