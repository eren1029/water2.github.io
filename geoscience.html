        How does geoscience help inform decisions on water availability?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Geoscientists study how water moves in order to locate and quantify surface water and water
          underground. They use
          models to predict how much water will be available under different scenarios of climate and societal demand. They
          also explore alternative water sources like water recycling and desalination of ocean water.

        <h2>General Overviews</h2>
          <p>These books, articles, and reports provide an introduction to water and overviews of water resource issues. Each tackles
    issues of water availability from a different perspective, although all integrate biophysical and social considerations to at least
    some extent. All are accessible to nontechnical audiences. Anisfeld 2010 provides the broadest overview, providing accessible
    but technical background information on many of the same topics that appear in this bibliography. Fishman 2011 takes a more
    populist approach, highlighting a variety of water issues through stories of water management, often when it has gone awry.
    Calder 2005 is much more practical, addressing water resources management and arguing for explicit integration with land
    management. Hoekstra 2013 is a survey of the ways water is used in the production of the products essential to our lives.
    Though agriculture is by far the largest human consumer of water, the availability of drinking water is immediately pertinent to
    many of us. Salzman 2012 explores the history and current state of drinking water. Gleick 2001 is a magazine article
    summarizing many of the challenges to water sustainability. The final paper in this section, United Nations 2003, focuses on
    water use and discusses the development of many widely used water availability indicators. Water quality affects the usability,
    and thus the effective availability, of water. However, for reasons of clarity and brevity, this article largely avoids directly
    addressing water quality. Schwarzenbach, et al. 2010 is included here to provide an overview of sources of water pollution and impacts to human health</p>

          <p>Four billion people — almost two thirds of the world’s population — experience severe water scarcity for at
            least one month each year.</p>
          <p>Over two billion people live in countries where water supply is inadequate.</p>
          <p>Half of the world’s population could be living in areas facing water scarcity by as early as 2025.</p>
          <p> 700 million people could be displaced by intense water scarcity by 2030.
          By 2040, roughly 1 in 4 children worldwide will be living in areas of extremely high water stress.</p>
